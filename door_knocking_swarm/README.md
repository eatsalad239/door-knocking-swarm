# Door‑Knocking Swarm

This repository contains a free, open‑source “swarm” of AI agents designed to help
door‑to‑door sales businesses level up their marketing, training and web
presence.  The project is intended as a starting point: you can run the
pre‑configured agents out of the box or extend them to suit your specific
industry and clients.

## What it does

The swarm bundles three specialised agents that can work independently or
co‑operatively:

* **Marketing Agent** – generates door‑knocking friendly marketing materials
  (flyers, pitch scripts, email templates and social copy) tailored to a
  particular product or service.  You feed it your
  client’s name and product details and it returns polished copy ready for
  design.
* **Training Agent** – produces onboarding and refresher training content for
  your door‑to‑door teams.  It can generate role‑play dialogues, objection
  handling tips and checklists that can be assembled into slides or handouts.
* **Web Agent** – scaffolds a simple responsive website for your client using
  predefined templates.  It inserts the marketing copy generated by the
  Marketing Agent and exports a zip file ready for deployment.

The agents are orchestrated with [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/), an
open‑source multi‑agent framework that makes it easy to coordinate
LLM‑powered assistants.  Each agent is defined with a clear role, goal and
backstory and is assigned to a task.  When you run the crew with
`python main.py` the agents collaborate to produce a marketing package for a
client.

## Installation

These agents require Python 3.10+ and rely on the `crewai` and `openai`
packages.  To get started:

```bash
# Clone this repository or download the source code
git clone <your‑fork‑url>
cd door_knocking_swarm

# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your OpenAI API key in the environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk‑...  # replace with your key

# Run the example crew
python main.py --client_name "Acme Solar" --product "solar panels"
```

## Next steps

This code is meant as a foundation.  You should customise the agents’ goals
and prompts to suit your industry, extend the web template generator and add
more tools such as email sending or PDF generation.  The [CrewAI
documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/) and the [OpenAI Swarm examples]
provide plenty of ideas for building larger multi‑agent systems.
